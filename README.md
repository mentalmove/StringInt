# StringInt

For efficiency reasons, computers usually calculate using a limited value range.

If necessary, this can be circumvented in two possible ways:  
    - Combining numbers and interpreting the result as single number with higher precision  
    - Interpreting a collection of symbols as single number

This project follows the second approach.  
It is not intended for usage in production environments
but as a proof of concept, maybe as fun stuff.

The idea behind it is teaching the machine
decimal calculation like human beings learned it at school.
